                      ******** USB/Device TRACKER ********

- Program will creates a database for storage of users and PINS
- Devices are storaged in just a .txt file due to drive names are not sensitive at this point.
- Program was created to keep track of external drives at work (USBs and other drives we keep locked)
- Program will keep track of all checked out devices by user and appending the date/time it was checked out
- The program will generate and send a email at the end of the day with the list of devices that have not been checked back in
- This basic program will only be modified as needed to fix the office needs at my employement
